### Create a conda environment on your own machine

When you install Anaconda, conda makes a single base environment for you. It is called `base` and this is why it says "(base)" at your terminal prompt. 
  For this course, you need a dedicated conda enviromnet for your exercises on both your local machine and on the cluster. Lets call both of them `popgen`.

The environmnet on your local machine does not need a lot of packages since it mainly serves to let you connect to the cluster. 
  This command creates a `popgen` enviromnet and installs `slurm-jupyter` from my conda channel along with a few other packages that may come in handy:

```bash
conda create --name SpatProt -c anaconda -c conda-forge -c plotly  
```

<!--
```bash
conda create --name popgen -c kaspermunch slurm-jupyter jupyter jupyterlab pandas numpy matplotlib ipympl nodejs seaborn scikit-learn statsmodels
```
